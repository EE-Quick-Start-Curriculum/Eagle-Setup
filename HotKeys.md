# HotKeys

Soon enough after using Eagle without hotkeys, you'll become weary of having to move the mouse to the
buttons.

While these are left completely up to you, I'll share the settings which work for me:

| hotkey | action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Cmd+n | Name |
| Cmd+t | Text |
| Cmd+m| Move | 
| Cmd+v | Value |
| Cmd+d | Delete |
