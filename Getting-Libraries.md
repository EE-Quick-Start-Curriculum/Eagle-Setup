In this section we'll go over how to add libraries to your project.

As an example, we'll go over how to add the libraries for SEEED's OPL.


#### Download The Parts

go to the following link and download the library (circled in red below):

#### Place the parts in your library (lbr)

unzip the opl zip and paste into your eagle's lbr (for me this was `EAGLE-6.6.0/lbr`)
