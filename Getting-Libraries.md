In this section we'll go over how to add libraries to your project.

As an example, we'll go over how to add the libraries for SEEED's OPL.


### Step 1) Download The Parts

#### go to the following link and download the library (circled in red below):

http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/File:OPL_eagle_library.zip

### Step 2) Place the parts in your library (lbr)

#### unzip the opl zip and paste into your eagle's lbr (for me this was `EAGLE-6.6.0/lbr`)
