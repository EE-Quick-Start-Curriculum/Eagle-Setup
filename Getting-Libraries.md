In this section we'll go over how to add libraries to your project.

As an example, we'll go over how to add the libraries for SEEED's OPL.


### Step 1) Download The Parts

go to the following link and download the library (circled in red below):

http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/File:OPL_eagle_library.zip

### Step 2) Place the parts in your library (lbr)

unzip the opl zip and paste into your eagle's lbr (for me this was `EAGLE-6.6.0/lbr`)

### Step 3) Activate The Libraries

Open the Eagle Program and go to the "Library folder" as in the image below:

Scroll down to OPL Eagle Library

Right click on folder and click "use all"

everything should now have green dots

Click "File" then "New Schematic"

---

Click the add Button

You should now have (somewhere in your options) the Opl Componenets:
